# How to start

**Note** that this seed project requires node v4.x.x or higher and npm 2.14.7.

**Here is how to [speed-up the build on Windows](https://github.com/mgechev/angular2-seed/wiki/Speed-up-the-build-on-Windows)**.

In order to start the seed use:


```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/mgechev/angular2-seed.git
cd angular2-seed
# install the project's dependencies
npm install
# watches your files and uses livereload by default
npm start
# api document for the app
# npm run build.docs

# dev build
npm run build.dev
# prod build
npm run build.prod
# prod build with AoT compilation
npm run build.prod.exp

# dev build of multiple applications (by default the value of --app is "app")
npm start -- --app baz
npm start -- --app foo
npm start -- --app bar
```
....
